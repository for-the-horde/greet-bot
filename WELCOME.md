👋 Hello @new_user_name and welcome to the For the Horde community! We're so happy you're here! The purpose of this community is to give you a space to connect with other Minnesota-based tech and tech-adjacent folks. Want to be successful here? Try to give more than you take.

✅ First things first. This is a community and we want this to be a safe and inclusive space for everyone. We expect you to abide by the For the Horde Code of Conduct in this Slack team AND while participating in any in-person or online For the Horde events. Please head on over to https://git.io/v0d6b to check it out.

Need to report Code of Conduct violation? The admins are listed at the bottom of the Code of Conduct. Snap a screenshot, report it.

🚴🏿‍♀️🕺🏻👩‍💻😻⚾️✈️📺 Second, you've automagically been added to the #introductions channel. Please introduce yourself to the community there and share something fun about yourself. Where you're from, what you're working on, what your most peculiar hobby is, what your favorite color is, etc... We want to get to know you! Also, there's probably a channel for that peculiar hobby.

📣 Speaking of channels. We have a lot. When thinking about where to post a message, go through the channel list and check there first. It’s very tempting with ~1200 eyeballs to post something to #general. We tend to treat #general like a watercooler, not a place to garner attention.

_Popular channels:_

- #frontend - talk about your javascript
- #devs-n-ops - do not talk about your javascript
- #cohordeworking - when, where, why, who
- #business - general business topics
- #mental-health - talk about it
- #event-share - a place to share cool events happening in Minnesota
- #gigs - the ONLY place you can post/ask for jobs/gigs. They should be 100% available to Minnesota with no filter criteria, à la “might be interested in remote” Many people have notifications on for this channel, so 🧵any conversations beyond the initial post.

_Fun, small channels:_

- #art-hackers
- #biking
- #awww
- #sports
- #nerdparenting

🦠 And then there’s COVID-19, the big 🐘 in the room. #general is a COVID-19 free zone. This is a **strict** policy and we will actively police it. While we understand it’s a hard time for everyone, you can’t leave #general and we want people to have a refuge as it is impacting many of us indirectly or directly.

SO with that:
#covid19-discuss - general discussion of COVID-19 related topics
#covid19-reference - fact based information sharing (links only, move discussions to #covid19-discuss)
#covid19-memes - the ONLY place to allow covid related memes (that also adhere to the Code of Conduct)

:spam: Spam posts, sales-y posts, self-promoting without community participation is not allowed. For the Horde is a community to **participate in**, not an audience to _broadcast to_. Admins will ask posts like this to be removed, especially in #general. If not removed promptly, we will remove it. If you're really sure the post benefits the audience more than yourself, be sure to put it in the most relevant channel.

💌 Want to invite someone? Head over to #invites and kindly answer these questions:
- Who would you like to invite? (name and email)
- Do they currently reside in Minnesota?
- Describe how they are tech or tech-adjacent.
- Are they expecting this invite? We only invite people who have opted in, otherwise we're obnoxious.
_Note:_ Please invite good humans that will read and abide by the Code of Conduct. You're using _your_ social capital to say "this is a good human."

❓Ask questions! It's good to read the room, but it's a big room with norms that have formed over a long time. It’s ok if you don't know how things work here or what things are appropriate.

🏊🏽‍♀️ And with that, dive right in and get started!
